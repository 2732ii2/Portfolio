The way I approached to this task is basically:
  - the most difficult and important was making the positioning of div's in which it's work beautifully .
    So basically if we have a good understanding of Positing in CSS then it easily make it.
  - And every thing is just React component.
  - Last but not least a Flexbox properties of CSS .
  
 That's all from my side.
